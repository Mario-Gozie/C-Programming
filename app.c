// Data types
// int = integer
// float = floating point number (decimals). this is typically 4bytes(32bits), so it has precision of about 7 decimal digits. used for storing smaller size of numbers.
// double = This is for decimal but 4bytes (64bits). it has a precision of about 15 decimal digits. so it is good for large size numbers
// Char = A single character
// Array = collection of elements of the same data type.
// pointer = stores memory address of another variabe.
// structure = allows grouping variable of different data type under a single name.
// union = similar to structure but shares the same memory location for all its members.
// enum = Defines a set of named integer constant


// In C, you must declare the data type of a variable before you use it
